In addition to the rich cultural wealth, Elche also offers first-rate cuisine, using a wide variety of products available in the region. The rich orchard and the proximity to the coast mark the culinary history of the city. The most famous dish in the cuisine of Elche is Arroz con Costra, but we must also highlight the rabbit and snail rice, without forgetting the traditional Puchero con Pelotas. The Mujol del Hondo and all the aiolis and seafood from the coast are also highly appreciated. In dessert, we must highlight the fruits of the land (dates, figs, pomegranates ...) and the Tortada de Elche or Pan de Higo. Among the traditional drinks, we find lavender flower distillate, star anise (popular "Nugolet") and date wine.
